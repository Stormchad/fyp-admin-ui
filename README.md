# fyp-admin-ui

## Overview:

This is a website that is used by the admin of a next generation store. The next generation store is a store that is running with our carts. Our carts have billing and item scanning systems integrated ( how cool ! ).  

Using our admin side UI, the admin is able to view the state of carts, how many items it has, has there been a checkout yet? What is the special code needed to connect for that cart. Add new items and keep track of inventory for that items. 

**Basically** We are exposing our endpoints to the admin so a non-technical person can use this.
